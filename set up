ðŸ“– Time Capsule Diary

ðŸ§© Problem Solved

Many people wish to preserve their present-day thoughts, photos, or goals and revisit them in the future. However, thereâ€™s no simple, secure way to store and automatically unlock such personal content after a chosen period.
Time Capsule Diary solves this by letting users send messages to their future selves, securely stored and revealed only on a specific future date.
